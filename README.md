# recsalmo (Rapid Typing and Characterization Tool for Whole Genome Sequencing Data of Salmonella)
# This project is intended to provide python package for rapidly analyzing genome assemblies of Salmonella bacteria. 

Prevalent foodborne pathogens that is Salmonella bacteria can cause serious illness which is mainly gastroenteritis 


Instructions:
1. All genome assembly files must be contained in a single folder; and that folder must not have any sub-folders.
2. The assembly files must be of the FASTA format.
3. For each name of a genome assembly file, the program assigns a string in front of the first period symbol to be the main output name. For instances, if the name of an assembly file is Assembly1.scaffolds.fasta, the main output name (and also the output folder name) becomes "Assembly1". 
4. The user must assign a single folder (in the command line) as the output folder. All the analysis results will be kept in this folder.
